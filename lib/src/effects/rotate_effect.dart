/// Effect that rotates the target between [begin] and [end] (via [RotationTransition]).
/// Values are specified in "turns", so a `begin=0.25, end=2.25` would start with the child
/// rotated a quarter turn clockwise (90 degrees), and rotate two full turns (ending at 810 degrees).
/// Defaults to `begin=-1.0, end=0`.
///
/// [alignment] lets you set the origin of the rotation (the point around which the rotation
/// will occur). For example an alignment of [Alignment.topLeft] would rotate around the top left
/// corner of the child. Defaults to [Alignment.center].
