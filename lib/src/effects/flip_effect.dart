/// An effect that animates a 2.5D card flip rotation effect (via a matrix [Transform]).
/// The effect can be horizontal or vertical.
///
/// The [begin] and [end] values specify the number of "flips" (ie. half turns,
/// 180deg or Pi radians) from nominal. For example, `0.5` would be a 90 degree
/// rotation (half a "flip").
/// It defaults to `begin=-0.5, end=0`.
///
/// [alignment] lets you set the origin of the rotation (ie. the point around which the rotation
/// will occur). For example an alignment of [Alignment.topCenter] would rotate around the top
/// of the child on a vertical flip. Default is [Alignment.center].
///
/// [perspective] lets you adjust the focal length for the 2.5D effect. A higher number
/// increases perspective transform (ie. reduces focal length). Default is `1`.
///
/// [direction] indicates the direction of the flip. For example [Axis.horizontal]
/// would cause it to rotate around the Y axis â€” flipping horizontally.
/// Default is [Axis.vertical].
