/// A special convenience "effect" that makes it easier to sequence effects after
/// one another. It does this by calculating a new inheritable delay by adding the
/// previous effect's `delay`, `duration` and its own optional `delay`.
///
/// For example, this would cause the scale to run 300 milliseconds after the fade
/// completes:
///
/// ```
/// Text("Hello").animate()
///   .fadeIn(delay: 300.ms, duration: 500.ms)
///   .then() // sets own delay to 800ms (300+500)
///   .slide(duration: 400.ms) // inherits the 800ms delay
///   .then(delay: 200.ms) // sets delay to 1400ms (800+400+200)
///   .blur() // inherits the 1400ms delay
///   // Explicitly setting delay overrides the inherited value.
///   // This move effect will run BEFORE the initial fade:
///   .move(delay: 0.ms)
/// ```
///
/// This makes it easy to change the delay or duration of the `fadeIn`, without
/// having to update the delay on `scale` to match.
///
/// Note that this simply calculates a new `delay` that will be inherited by the
/// subsequent effect. In the example above, it is functionally equivalent to
/// setting `delay: 1400.ms` on the blur effect.
