/// Effect that swaps out the incoming child for a new child at a particular
/// point in time. This includes all preceding effects. It uses a builder so
/// that the effect can be reused, but note that the builder is only called once
/// when the effect initially builds.
///
/// For example, this would fade out `foo`, swap it for `Bar()` (including
/// discarding the `fadeOut` effect) and apply a fade in effect.
///
/// ```
/// foo.animate()
///   .fadeOut(duration: 500.ms)
///   .swap( // inherits duration from fadeOut
///     builder: (_, __) => Bar().animate().fadeIn(),
///   )
/// ```
///
/// It also includes the original child of the animation as a parameter of the
/// builder. For example, normally fading out and then back in will not work
/// as expected because both effects are active (ie. the 0 opacity from
/// fading out is still applied), but you can work around this by beginning a
/// new animation with the original child:
///
/// ```
/// foo.animate()
///   .fadeOut(duration: 500.ms)
///   .swap( // inherits duration from fadeOut
///     builder: (_, originalChild) => originalChild.animate().fadeIn(),
///   )
/// ```
///
/// Note that the builder is returning a new [Animate] instance with its own
/// [AnimationController]. So, for example, repeating the first animation (the
/// fade out) via its controller will not affect the second animation (fade in).
