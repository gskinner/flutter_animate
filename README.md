Flutter Animate
================================================================================

A performant library that makes it simple to add almost any kind of animated 
effect in Flutter.

1. Pre-built effects, like fade, scale, slide, flip, blur, shake, shimmer, 
   shadows, crossfades, follow path, and color effects (saturation, color, and
   tint)
2. Easy custom effects and simplified animated builders
3. Synchronize animations to scroll, notifiers, or anything
4. Integrated events

All via a simple, unified API without fussing with AnimationController and
StatefulWidget.

Duration extensions
----------------------------------------

Extension methods for `num`, to make specifying durations easier. For example:
`2.seconds`, `0.1.minutes`, or `300.ms`.


AnimatedController extensions
----------------------------------------

A `loop` extension method for `AnimatedController` which is identical to
`repeat`, but adds a `count` parameter to specifiy how many times to play.


Basics
================================================================================

Syntax
----------------------------------------

To apply effects, wrap the target widget in `Animate`, and specify a list of
effects:

``` dart
Animate(
  effects: [FadeEffect(), ScaleEffect()],
  child: Text("Hello World!"),
)
```

It also adds an `.animate()` extension method to all widgets, which wraps the
widget in `Animate()`. Each effect also adds a chainable extension method to
`Animate` to enable a shorthand syntax:

``` dart
Text("Hello World!").animate().fade().scale()
```

> **NOTE:** The shortform style is used in this README, but all functionality is
> available in either format.

Delay, duration, curve, reverseCurve
----------------------------------------

Effects have optional `delay`, `duration`, `curve`, and `reverseCurve` parameters. Effects run
in parallel, but you can use a `delay` to run them sequentially:

``` dart
Text("Hello").animate()
  .fade(duration: 500.ms)
  .scale(delay: 500.ms) // runs after fade.
```

Note that effects are "active" for the duration of the full animation, so for
example, two fade effects on the same target can have unexpected results
(`SwapEffect` detailed below, can help address this).

If not specified (or null), these values are inherited from the previous effect,
or from `Animate.defaultDuration` and `Animate.defaultCurve` if it is the first
effect:

``` dart
Text("Hello World!").animate()
  .fadeIn() // uses `Animate.defaultDuration`
  .scale() // inherits duration from fadeIn
  .move(delay: 300.ms, duration: 600.ms) // runs after the above w/new duration
  .blurXY() // inherits the delay & duration from move
```

`Animate` has its own `delay` parameter, which defines a delay before the
animation begins playing. Unlike the delay on an `Effect`, it is only applied
once if the animation repeats.

``` dart
Text("Hello").animate(
    delay: 1000.ms, // this delay only happens once at the very start
    onPlay: (controller) => controller.repeat(), // loop
  ).fadeIn(delay: 500.ms) // this delay happens at the start of each loop
```

Other Effect Parameters
----------------------------------------
Most effects include `begin` and `end` parameters, which specify the start/end
values. These are usually "smart" in the sense that if only one is specified
then the other will default to a "neutral" value (ie. no visual effect). If
both are unspecified the effect should use visually pleasing defaults.

``` dart
// an opacity of 1 is "neutral"
Text("Hello").animate().fade() // begin=0, end=1
Text("Hello").animate().fade(begin: 0.5) // end=1
Text("Hello").animate().fade(end: 0.5) // begin=1
```

Many effects have additional parameters that influence their behavior. These
should also use pleasant defaults if unspecified.

``` dart
Text('Hello').animate().tint(color: Colors.purple)
```

Sequencing with ThenEffect
----------------------------------------
`ThenEffect` is a special convenience "effect" that makes it easier to sequence
effects. It does this by establishing a new baseline time equal to the previous
effect's end time and its own optional `delay`. All subsequent effect delays are
relative to this new baseline.

In the following example, the slide would run 200ms after the fade ended.

``` dart
Text("Hello").animate()
  .fadeIn(duration: 600.ms)
  .then(delay: 200.ms) // baseline=800ms
  .slide()
```

Animating lists
----------------------------------------

The `AnimateList` class offers similar functionality for lists of widgets, with
the option to offset each child's animation by a specified `interval`:

``` dart
Column(children: AnimateList(
  interval: 400.ms,
  effects: [FadeEffect(duration: 300.ms)],
  children: [Text("Hello"), Text("World"),  Text("Goodbye")],
))

// or shorthand:
Column(
  children: [Text("Hello"), Text("World"),  Text("Goodbye")]
    .animate(interval: 400.ms).fade(duration: 300.ms),
)
```

Shared effects
----------------------------------------

Because `Effect` instances are immutable, they can be reused. This makes it easy
to create a global collection of effects that are used throughout your app and
updated in one place. This is also useful for design systems.

``` dart
MyGlobalEffects.transitionIn = <Effect>[
  FadeEffect(duration: 100.ms, curve: Curves.easeOut),
  ScaleEffect(begin: 0.8, curve: Curves.easeIn)
]

// then:
Text('Hello').animate(effects: MyGlobalEffects.transitionIn)
```


Custom effects & builders
================================================================================

It is easy to write new resuable effects by extending `Effect`, but you can also
easily create one-off custom effects by using `CustomEffect`, `ToggleEffect`,
and `SwapEffect`.

CustomEffect
----------------------------------------

`CustomEffect` lets you build custom animated effects. Simply specify a
`builder` function that accepts a `context`, `value`, and `child`. The child is
the target of the animation (which may already have been wrapped in other
effects).

For example, this would add a background behind the text and fade it from red to
blue:

``` dart
Text("Hello World").animate().custom(
  duration: 300.ms,
  builder: (context, value, child) => Container(
    color: Color.lerp(Colors.red, Colors.blue, value),
    padding: EdgeInsets.all(8),
    child: child, // child is the Text widget being animated
  )
)
```

By default it provides a `value` from `0-1` (though some curves can generate
values outside this range), based on the current time, duration, and curve. You
can also specify `begin` and `end` values as demonstrated in the example below.

`Animate` can be created without a child, so you use `CustomEffect` as a
simplified builder. For example, this would build text counting down from 10,
and fading out:

``` dart
Animate().custom(
  duration: 10.seconds,
  begin: 10,
  end: 0,
  builder: (_, value, __) => Text(value.round()),
).fadeOut()
```


ToggleEffect
----------------------------------------

`ToggleEffect` also provides builder functionality, but instead of a `double`,
it provides a boolean value equal to `true` before the end of the effect and
`false` after (ie. after its duration).

``` dart
Animate().toggle(
  duration: 2.seconds,
  builder: (_, value, __) => Text(value ? "Before" : "After"),
)
```

This can also be used to activate "Animated" widgets, like `AnimatedContainer`,
by toggling their values with a minimal delay:

``` dart
Animate().toggle(
  duration: 1.ms,
  builder: (_, value, __) => AnimatedContainer(
    duration: 1.seconds,
    color: value ? Colors.red : Colors.green,
  ),
)
```

SwapEffect
----------------------------------------

`SwapEffect` lets you swap out the whole target widget at a specified time:

``` dart
Text("Before").animate()
  .swap(duration: 900.ms, builder: (_, __) => Text("After"))
```

This can also be useful for creating sequential effects, by swapping the target
widget back in, effectively wiping all previous effects:

``` dart
text.animate().fadeOut(300.ms) // fade out & then...
  // swap in original widget & fade back in via a new Animate:
  .swap(builder: (_, child) => child.animate().fadeIn())
```


Events & callbacks
================================================================================

`Animate` includes the following callbacks:

- `onInit`: the internal `AnimationController` has been initialized
- `onPlay`: the animation has started playing after any `Animate.delay`
- `onComplete`: the animation has finished

These callbacks return the `AnimationController`, which can be used to
manipulate the animation (ex. repeat, reverse, etc).

``` dart
Text("Horrible Pulsing Text")
  .animate(onPlay: (controller) => controller.repeat(reverse: true))
  .fadeOut(curve: Curves.easeInOut)
```

For more nuanced callbacks, use `CallbackEffect` or `ListenEffect`.

CallbackEffect
----------------------------------------

`CallbackEffect` lets you add a callback to an arbitrary postion in your
animations. For example, adding a callback halfway through a fade:

``` dart
Text("Hello").animate().fadeIn(duration: 600.ms)
  .callback(duration: 300.ms, callback: (_) => print('halfway'))
```

As with other effects, it will inherit the delay and duration of prior effects:

``` dart
Text("Hello").animate().scale(delay: 200.ms, duration: 400.ms)
  .callback(callback: (_) => print('scale is done'))
```

ListenEffect
----------------------------------------

`ListenEffect` lets you register a callback to receive the animation value (as a
`double`) for a given delay, duration, curve, begin, and end.

``` dart
Text("Hello").animate().fadeIn(curve: Curves.easeOutExpo)
  .listen(callback: (value) => print('current opacity: $value'))
```

The above example works, because the listen effect inherits duration and curve
from the fade, and both use `begin=0, end=1` by default.


Adapters and Controllers
================================================================================

By default, all animations are driven by an internal `AnimationController`, and
update based on elapsed time. For more control, you can specify your own
external `controller`, or use an `adapter`. You can also set `autoPlay=false` if
you want to start the animation manually.

Adapters synchronize the `AnimationController` to an external source. For
example, the `ScrollAdapter` updates an animation based on a `ScrollController`
so you can run complex animations based on scroll interactions.

You still define animations using durations, but the external source must
provide a `0-1` value.

Flutter Animate ships with a collection of useful adapters. Check them out for
more information.


Reacting to State Changes
================================================================================
`Animate` can react to state changes similar to "Animated" widgets (ex.
`AnimatedOpacity`). Simply set up your animation normally, but set a `target`
value. When the value of `target` changes, it will automatically animate to the 
new target position (where `0` is the beginning and `1` is the end).

For example, combined with logic that toggles `_over` via `setState`, this will
fade and scale the button on roll over:

``` dart
MyButton().animate(target: _over ? 1 : 0)
  .fade(end: 0.8).scaleXY(end: 1.1)
```


Testing Animations
================================================================================
When testing animations, you can set `Animate.restartOnHotReload=true` which
will cause all animations to automatically restart every time you hot reload
your app.
